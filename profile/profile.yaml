summary: I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor Of Science in Computer Science and Statistics. With 1.5 years worth of experience as a Data Scientist and Software, I was privileged enough to get the opportunity to hone my technical and soft skills in a professional environment. Apart from the work experience, I have multiple Full-Stack projects under my belt that describe my proficiency in Django, React, Python, Javascript, and AWS specifically.

    description: Built an MVP for the LCA team that manages a Linux CentOS 7 cluster of multiple servers. This project monitors and records the Linux server usage data for any given machine, storing the data in a PostgreSQL RDBMS database. Although meant to aggregate hardware usage data for further analytics and future resource planning, this project also records and stores hardware specifications. Here, I developed bash scripts that initialise a PostgreSQL database using Docker containers, record the hardware specifications of the machine this project is run on in tables within the aforementioned database, and record per-minute hardware usage data using a crontab. Git, Github, and the Gitflow version control model were used for version control. I configured the crontab to run the host_usage.sh bash script per minute automating data collection for further analysis

    description: "I designed and implemented a full-stack custom web application using React and Django that allows users to host their properties and users to reserve properties for vacations for specific dates they are available during. The authentication and authorization was managed through the Django REST Framework and data was stored in the SQLite relational database. React-bootstrap was used for styling and modern React infrastructure related features and best practices such as Context and Outlet were used for front-end programming."

    git_url: "https://github.com/msaimam98/FakeComm"
    description: "I designed and implemented an e-commerce store that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The front-end was styled using React-Bootstrap and miscellaneous CSS properties and structured using React. The AWS Serverless architecture was utilised for the backend. More specifically, APIs were coded using AWS API Gateway alongside Lambda functions, data was stored in a NoSQL DynamoDB, user authentication and authorization was managed using AWS Cognito with AWS Resource permissions managed using a mix of Bucket policies, IAM Users, and IAM Roles, and the project was hosted/deployed using S3 Buckets in tandem with AWS Cloudfront for global deployment. Git, Github, and Github Desktop were used for version control."
  - name: "Monitoring Stack"
    git_url: "https://github.com/msaimam98/Monitoring-Stack"
    description: "I designed and created the architecture of a centralised logging system using Fluentd and Docker containers. Fluent-bit was used to receive + parse logs and send them to a Fluentd container, which in turn redirected the logs to a single-node Elasticsearch container. Logs were displayed in a user-friendly environment using Elasticsearch and Kibana for further data analysis."
