    description: "Built an MVP for the LCA (Linux Cluster Administration) team that manages a Linux CentOS 7 cluster of multiple servers. This project uses bash scripts to monitor and record the Linux server usage and hardware data in a Dockerized PostgreSQL database for analytics and future resource planning.I automated recording per-minute hardware usage data using a crontab.

    description: "I designed and implemented a full-stack custom web application using React and Django that allows users to host and reserve real-estate properties on specific dates. The authentication and authorization was managed through the Django REST Framework and data was stored in the SQLite relational database. React-bootstrap was used for styling and modern React infrastructure related features and best practices such as Context and Outlet were used for front-end programming."

    git_url: "https://github.com/msaimam98/FakeComm"
    description: "I designed and implemented an e-commerce store that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The front-end was styled using React-Bootstrap and miscellaneous CSS properties and structured using React. The AWS Serverless architecture was utilised for the backend. More specifically, APIs were coded using AWS API Gateway alongside Lambda functions. Data was stored in a NoSQL DynamoDB. User authentication and authorization was managed using AWS Cognito, and AWS Resource permissions managed using a mix of Bucket policies, IAM Users, and IAM Roles. The project was hosted/deployed using S3 Buckets in tandem with AWS Cloudfront for global deployment. Git, Github, and Github Desktop were used for version control."
  - name: "Monitoring Stack"
    git_url: "https://github.com/msaimam98/Monitoring-Stack"
    description: "I designed and created the architecture of a centralised logging system using Fluentd and Docker containers. Fluent-bit was used to receive and parse logs and send them to a Fluentd container, which in turn redirected the logs to a single-node Elasticsearch container. Logs were displayed in a user-friendly environment using Elasticsearch and Kibana for further data analysis"
